As [alex said](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7073484/how-does-this-css-triangle-shape-work/7073503#7073503), borders of equal width butt up against each other at 45 degree angles:

When you have no top border, it looks like this:

Then you give it a width of 0...

...and a height of 0...

...and finally, you make the two side borders transparent:

That results in a triangle.
